# Selenium-testingFramework
Note: Since This framework uses later chrome version, And Google have provided different chrome browser that is to used only for testing. Moving forward the version 114 in chrome , we cannot use existing same chrome browser for all purpoes(browsing and Automation testing)  
1. Download chrome Testing browser and place it under path(src/main/resources/driver)
2. And Chrome driver 


If user is having chromebrowser verion 114 and previous, 

    update the code for webdriver manager at location "src/main/java/utility/utils/DriverSetUp.java"
